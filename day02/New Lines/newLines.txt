New Lines
To insert a new line, you can use the \n character:

Tip: Two \n characters after each other will create a blank line:

Another way to insert a new line, is with the endl manipulator:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
  cout << "I am learning C++";
  return 0;
}


Both \n and endl are used to break lines. However, \n is most used.

But what is \n exactly?
The newline character (\n) is called an escape sequence, and it forces the cursor to change its position to the beginning of the next line on the screen. This results in a new line.

Examples of other valid escape sequences are:

Escape Sequence	Description
\t	Creates a horizontal tab	
\\	Inserts a backslash character (\)
